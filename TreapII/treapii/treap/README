This package implements a treap-based dictionary-like interface for Python.

There are two versions here - one is in pure Python, one is partly in Cython.

The pure Python version may actually be a bit faster at about 100,000
values, but the Cython version is vastly faster for larger collections.

The nest.py module is a quick demo of what you might use a treap for.  It
keeps the n lowest (or n highest) values from a potentially large series of
values.
